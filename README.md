## 🔍 Overview

Phishing attacks are a major cybersecurity threat, deceiving users into revealing sensitive data. Traditional blacklist and rule-based methods are inadequate against new attacks. This project uses ML algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, and Decision Tree to classify URLs as **legitimate** or **phishing**.
