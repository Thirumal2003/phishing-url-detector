## 🔍 Overview

Phishing attacks are a major cybersecurity threat, deceiving users into revealing sensitive data. Traditional blacklist and rule-based methods are inadequate against new attacks. This project uses ML algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, and Decision Tree to classify URLs as **legitimate** or **phishing**.

## 💻 Technologies Used

- Python
- Flask
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- NLTK
- Joblib

---

## 🛠 Usage

- Enter a URL into the input form

- The model analyzes it and returns either:

✅ Legitimate

🚫 Phishing

---
## 📂 Dataset

- 11,430 URLs

- 50% phishing, 50% legitimate

- 87 extracted features per URL

- Balanced dataset ensures reliable model training

---

## 📈 Results

- Logistic Regression achieved the highest testing accuracy of 91%

- Confusion matrix and classification reports generated for all models

= Feature engineering and dimensionality reduction improved performance

---

## 🌱 Future Enhancements

- Real-time URL monitoring (browser plugin)

- Integration with deep learning (LSTM/CNN)

- HTML/content-based phishing detection

- API deployment for enterprise use

- Mobile compatibility and alerts

- Multi-layer integration with cybersecurity systems
